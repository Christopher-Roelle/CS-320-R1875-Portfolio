Portfolio from Software Test Automation &amp; QA

## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I ensured that my code was functional and secure through the use of automated JUnit tests that would test the different implementations and functions of the code
and ensure that the code behaved in the expected way that the client requested. I tested for overflow scenarios, as well as for bogus data that a customer or user could
potentially pass through the software, and ensured that I had 100% coverage of all systems written within the tests.
## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Primarily through the use of User Stories and cases, I ensure that I understand the intended use that is expected, and write the software to fit within the intended use-case.
Once I interpret the needs and ask questions to clear any confusion, I will prototype the code, and if possible, get user feedback, if the requester (client/customer) is available,
they tend to be a better subject to user-test, but a peer works as well. If the requester has any changes or feedback, I will implement and repeat, until we hit satisfaction.
## How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software from a 'Measure Twice, Cut Once' mentality. Its better to understand the needs and intended use-case of the code before writing it.
That is not to say that I won't modify code to make it more efficient, or more readable. I do view it as a "If I understand the intended use, then I can write more efficiently,
which will in turn, make future adjustments easier."

I also view testing as an integral part, and often find myself over testing to ensure that I catch as many defects in my code as possible.
